# Cafe Employee Management Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack application for managing cafes and their employees. The front-end is built with ReactJS, Redux, Redux-Saga, React Router, Material-UI, and AgGrid. The back-end is a .NET Core web API, and the database is MySQL.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Yarn (v1.22 or higher)
- .NET 8.0
- MySQL Server
- Visual Studio Code or any other preferred code editor

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/isajidh/cafe_management_system.git
cd cafe_management_system
```

### 2. Setting Up the MySQL Database

1. **Create a Database**:

   ```sh
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE cafe_management_db;
   USE cafe_management_db;
   ```

2. **Import the Database Schema and Data**:
   Use the provided `cafe_management_schema.sql` file to set up the database schema and data:
   ```sh
   mysql -u root -p cafe_management_db < path/to/cafe_management_schema.sql
   ```

### 3. Setting Up the .NET Core Web API

1. **Navigate to the API Directory**:

   ```sh
   cd CafeEmployeeManager.API
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**:

   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Update Connection String**:
   Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to match your MySQL database configuration:

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=cafe_management_db;User=root;Password=yourpassword;"
   }
   ```

4. **Run the API**:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

### 4. Setting Up the ReactJS Front-End

1. **Navigate to the React Application Directory**:

   ```sh
   cd ../CafeEmployeeManager.UI
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the React Application**:
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

### 5. Running Tests

To run the unit tests for the React application:

```sh
yarn test
```

## Usage

  - Features include adding a new employee, and editing/deleting employees.

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Errors**:

  - **Database Connection**: Ensure your MySQL server is running and the connection string in `appsettings.json` is correct.
  - **API Not Running**: Ensure you have navigated to the API directory and run `dotnet run`.

- **Logs and Debugging**:
  - Check the terminal for any error messages and stack traces.
  - For database-related issues, check MySQL logs.
